# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a simple static website project for TK. The repository contains minimal structure with only basic HTML files.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html` - Main website file (currently empty)
- `README.md` - Basic project description

## Development

This appears to be a basic static website project with no build system, package manager, or development dependencies configured. Files can be edited directly and viewed in a web browser.

To serve the site locally, you can use any static file server such as:
- `python -m http.server 8000` (Python)
- `npx serve .` (Node.js)
- Open `index.html` directly in a browser

## Architecture

The project currently has a minimal structure suitable for a simple static website. There are no frameworks, build tools, or complex architecture patterns in place.

## Conversion Notes

- Convert existing Wix website to a traditional HTML, CSS, and JavaScript implementation
