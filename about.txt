Welcome
Over the last few years, I have become a sought-after speaker and consultant, delivering impactful presentations and workshops. I've conducted DOC Training for Correction Officers and Staff, led Restorative 101 sessions at Mt. Holyoke College and local high schools, and facilitated Restorative Justice 101 sessions at the prestigious Harvard Radcliffe Institute. I was also the keynote speaker at the "Stop The Violence" event in Lawrence, MA, which was attended by over 1,000 students and covered by WV Channel 5. My unique lived experience, combined with my extensive professional background, equips me to deliver training that is both transformative and actionable for organizations, educators, and communities.

My Story
As the leader of Teen Empowerment's Prevention Program, I am dedicated to supporting young men transitioning from incarceration by providing essential resources and training for successful reintegration. With a BA in Liberal Arts and Sciences from Boston University I merge educational insights with a restorative justice approach, actively contributing to a decrease in recidivism rates. Co-founding Restorative Justice Group at MCI Norfolk and TPP reflects my commitment to transformative community work, where our pioneering programs create for dialogue and healing. As a Certified Restorative Justice Facilitator and Trainer, I advocate for youth and champion practices that foster resilience and growth.
